## My song  1{#anchor}



## my second song 2


That *Arizona* sky burning in your **eyes**

You `look` at me and, babe i wanna catch on fire^2^~2~

Its ~~buried~~ in my soul like California gold:\*\_\\

You found the light in me that I coudn't:--,find:---





The area of the pie is $A=\pi*r^{2}$
Another equation $$E=mc^{2}$$


>so: when Im choked up 



#### But I cant find the words

###### Baby, it hurts

When the sun goes down
 And the band wont play
I'll always remember us this way


Lovers in the night 
Poets trying to write
We don't know how to rhyme
But, damn, we try
But all i really know
You're where i wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die
